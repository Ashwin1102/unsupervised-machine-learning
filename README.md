# Gaussian mixtures + Expectation maximization
In this project, I built a Gaussian Mixture Model from scratch. I utilized toy data generated from normal and binomial distributions and implemented the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to achieve convergence and estimate the distribution parameters.

Additionally, I applied the same EM steps to develop a K-Means algorithm and evaluated its performance using the Gini index and purity as evaluation metrics.
